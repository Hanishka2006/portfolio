  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi! I'm <strong>Hanishka</strong>, a 3rd year B.Tech student specializing in <strong>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning</strong>. I'm deeply fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems—and that's what drew me into the world of programming and web development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I started my journey with programming languages like <strong>Python, Java, C, C++, and R</strong>, and now I'm exploring the front-end world with <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>. This portfolio is part of my learning path—my first real attempt at turning what I’ve learned into something I can share.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy learning by doing, experimenting, and figuring things out step-by-step. Whether it's writing logic in Python or styling a webpage, I love the creative process of building things from scratch.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for visiting my site! I'm excited about where this journey will lead, and I can’t wait to build more meaningful projects in the future.
